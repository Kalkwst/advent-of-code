/**
 * Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much.
 *
 * <p>The elves bought too much eggnog again - 150 liters this time. To fit it all into your
 * refrigerator, you'll need to move it into smaller containers. You take an inventory of the
 * capacities of the available containers.
 *
 * <p>For example, suppose you have containers of size 20, 15, 10, 5, and 5 liters. If you need to
 * store 25 liters, there are four ways to do it:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>15 and 10
 *   <li>20 and 5 (the first 5)
 *   <li>20 and 5 (the second 5)
 *   <li>15, 5, and 5
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Part One</h2>
 *
 * Filling all containers entirely, how many different combinations of containers can exactly fit
 * all 150 liters of eggnog?
