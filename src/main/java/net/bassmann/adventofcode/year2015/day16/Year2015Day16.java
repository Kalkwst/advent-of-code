/**
 * Day 16: Aunt Sue.
 *
 * <p>Your Aunt Sue has given you a wonderful gift, and you'd like to send her a thank you card.
 * However, there's a small problem: she signed it "From, Aunt Sue".
 *
 * <p>You have 500 Aunts named "Sue".
 *
 * <p>So, to avoid sending the card to the wrong person, you need to figure out which Aunt Sue
 * (which you conveniently number 1 to 500, for sanity) gave you the gift. You open the present and,
 * as luck would have it, good ol' Aunt Sue got you a My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine! Just
 * what you wanted. Or needed, as the case may be.
 *
 * <p>The My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine (MFCSAM for short) can detect a few specific
 * compounds in a given sample, as well as how many distinct kinds of those compounds there are.
 * According to the instructions, these are what the MFCSAM can detect:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>children, by human DNA age analysis.
 *   <li>cats. It doesn't differentiate individual breeds.
 *   <li>Several seemingly random breeds of dog: samoyeds, pomeranians, akitas, and vizslas.
 *   <li>goldfish. No other kinds of fish.
 *   <li>trees, all in one group.
 *   <li>cars, presumably by exhaust or gasoline or something.
 *   <li>perfumes, which is handy, since many of your Aunts Sue wear a few kinds.
 * </ul>
 *
 * In fact, many of your Aunts Sue have many of these. You put the wrapping from the gift into the
 * MFCSAM. It beeps inquisitively at you a few times and then prints out a message on ticker tape:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>children: 3
 *   <li>cats: 7
 *   <li>samoyeds: 2
 *   <li>pomeranians: 3
 *   <li>akitas: 0
 *   <li>vizslas: 0
 *   <li>goldfish: 5
 *   <li>trees: 3
 *   <li>cars: 2
 *   <li>perfumes: 1
 * </ul>
 *
 * You make a list of the things you can remember about each Aunt Sue. Things missing from your list
 * aren't zero - you simply don't remember the value.
 *
 * <h2>Part One</h2>
 *
 * What is the number of the Sue that got you the gift?
